## Getting Started
Eventually, and ideally, there will be a way to install this to many Computers

## Contributing
As usual, **pull _before_ pushing.** This is especially important if you are working on main for some reason.

Please, please, make good comments in your code. Please. This will help with general readability and debugging.

In the words of Kendal Jenner
>You can get a million comments about how beautiful you look and how awesome you are, but the one comment that says they hate you and you're ugly is the one that sticks.
Most importantly, have fun working!
