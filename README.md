# Project - Whist
Project for Software Design Fall 2017

## Getting Started
Eventually, and ideally, there will be a way to install this to many Computers

## Contributing
As usual, **pull _before_ pushing.** This is especially important if you are working on main for some reason.

Please, please, make good comments in your code. Please. This will help with general readability and debugging.

In the words of Kendal Jenner
>You can get a million comments about how beautiful you look and how awesome you are, but the one comment that says they hate you and you're ugly is the one that sticks.

Most importantly, have fun working!

### Extra notes
- Make sure to do work in the correct branch. Use `git branch` to see which branch you are currently working in.
- `git checkout mybranch` where mybranch is the name of the branch you want to do your work in
- For now, let's use branch names that follow this basic guideline: [Branch naming](https://stackoverflow.com/a/6065944)
-  - Don't worry too much about reading that whole response, but do try to follow the new/myfile or wip/myfile guideline
-  - This will just make things easier when we have multiple merge requests floating around
- It only seems fair, that every merge request should be seen by all four of us before being merged by the original creator
